# Drone_Fligt 
#To run use startGame.py 
#To change search technique go to gameProblem-->Setup-->algorithm (supports simpleai.search library)
The idea is to solve a search problem where a drone flies from its base to different locations to take pictures,
and then flies back to its base. The drone cannot fly over the water, and the drone has unlimited battery. The cost of the solution will be the total number of movements performed by the drone.
